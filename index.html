    <h1>Welcome to the Austin Code Dojo!</h1>
    <p>We are a group of software craftsman who meet regularly for deliberate
    practice in the art of software design and construction. Our meetings cover a varied
    array of topics, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Test Driven Design</li>
        <li>Build Automation</li>
        <li>Cloud Technologies</li>
    </ul>
    and anything else we think is interesting and can help us learn to be better
    software developers.</p>

    <p>
    If you want to hear about what's going on at the Dojo, check out our mailing
    list on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/austin-code-dojo">Google

    code we've worked on in meetings.
