simple. 

Things for future meetings
--------------------------
* Trying different frameworks

  Given some of the content at the recent No Fluff Just Stuff, there is some
  interest in playing with different testing frameworks. Greg mentioned two
  frameworks specifically for working with acceptance testing on web
  applications, Spock and Geb.

  * Spock is a BDD test framework built on top of JUnit and written in Groovy. It
    is a generic test framework that can be used for any testing application.

    http://spockframework.org

  * Geb is a Groovy library that is built on top of Selenium and provides a nice
    DSL for driving interaction with a web page. It's real strength is in its
    DSL feature for creating [Page Objects](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects).

    http://www.gebish.org

* Trying different languages
  
  There was also interest expressed in working in languages other than Java,
  both on and off the JVM. Nothing definite was decided but some examples that
  came up were:

  * [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org)
  * [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
  * [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org)

  Another possibility might be taking a look at the _Seven Languages in Seven
  Weeks_ book by Brian Tate.
