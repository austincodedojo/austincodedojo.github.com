* Greg Symons

* Steve Suehs 
* Sukant Hajra 

What we did
-----------

Our original plan was to possibly play around with NetKernel, and see what it
can do, but no one really knew how to get started, so we decided to work the
Roman Numerals Kata instead. We thought about working it in Clojure, but, in a
recurring theme, we quickly realized that none of us (with the exception of
Steve, who took off early) knew how to get started. So we fell back to working
in Java.

While we worked it there was an interesting discussion about TDD itself. Sukant
brought up his concern that "militant" TDD amounts to a hill-climbing algorithm,
and while it may converge very quickly on a locally optimal solution for a
class, it can easily miss architectural concerns that can't be easily driven by
the tests themselves. As a group, we didn't really reach a consensus, but it was
a good discussion. 


All the code is on [GitHub][1]

Things for future meetings
--------------------------

If we want to work in new languages or experiment with unfamiliar technologies,
someone needs to take ownership of figuring out how to get started, and possibly
come up with a problem to solve with the technology.

Next Meeting
------------

Our next meeting will be held on Wednesday, September 14, 2011 from 6pm-10pm. We
will be looking into working with [genetic algorithms][2]. Please [sign up][3] if you
plan on coming.
